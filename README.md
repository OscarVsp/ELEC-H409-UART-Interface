# UART interface with sequential buffer

This is an UART interface in VHDL to sequentially send then recevied data to/from an FPGA. The size of the input and output data can be customized.

The UART transmitter is based on the one from [Peter Bennett](https://github.com/pabennett/uart).

A small python script is also provided to send and received the data.
